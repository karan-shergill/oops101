# Builder Pattern Thread Safety Analysis

## Quick Answer: **Builder pattern is NOT thread-safe by default**

## Thread Safety Issues in Original Implementation

### ❌ Problems in Builder_1.java and Builder_2.java:

```java
class ProductBuilder {
    private Product1 product;  // ⚠️ Shared mutable state
    
    public ProductBuilder() {
        this.product = new Product1();  // ⚠️ Single instance
    }
    
    public Product1 build() {
        return this.product;  // ⚠️ Same object returned every time
    }
}
```

**Race Conditions:**
- Multiple threads calling `setName()` simultaneously
- Thread A sets name "Milk", Thread B sets name "Bread" 
- Final product might have inconsistent state

**Shared Instance Problem:**
- All `build()` calls return the same object reference
- Modifications by one thread affect all other threads

## ✅ Thread-Safe Solutions

### 1. **Individual Builder Instances (Recommended)**
```java
// Each thread creates its own builder
Thread 1: new MilkBuilder().setName("Milk").build();
Thread 2: new MilkBuilder().setName("Bread").build();
```

### 2. **Immutable Products (Your Fixed Implementation)**
```java
class Milk extends Product22 {
    private final String name;  // ✅ Immutable
    private final long id;      // ✅ Immutable
    
    // Constructor-only initialization
    Milk(String name, long id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Synchronized Shared Builder**
```java
class ThreadSafeBuilder {
    public synchronized Builder setName(String name) { ... }
    public synchronized Builder setId(long id) { ... }
    public synchronized Product build() { ... }
}
```

## Thread Safety Levels

| Approach | Thread Safety | Performance | Recommended |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Original Builder | ❌ Not Safe | Fast | No |
| Individual Builders | ✅ Safe | Fast | **Yes** |
| Synchronized Builder | ✅ Safe | Slower | Sometimes |
| Immutable Products | ✅ Safe | Fast | **Yes** |

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
1. **Use individual builder instances per thread**
2. **Make products immutable** (like in Builder_2_fix.java)
3. **Create new product instance in each build()**
4. **Use final fields in product classes**
5. **Validate in build() method**

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Share builder instances between threads**
2. **Return same product instance from build()**
3. **Allow product mutation after construction**
4. **Rely on external synchronization**

## Your Implementation Analysis

### Builder_1.java & Builder_2.java (Original)
- ❌ **NOT Thread-Safe**
- Shared mutable state
- Same instance returned
- Race conditions possible

### Builder_1_fix.java & Builder_2_fix.java (Fixed)
- ✅ **Thread-Safe when used correctly**
- Immutable products
- New instance creation
- Individual builder usage recommended

## Conclusion

**Your fixed implementations (Builder_1_fix.java and Builder_2_fix.java) are much better for thread safety because:**

1. **Immutable Products**: Cannot be modified after creation
2. **New Instance Creation**: Each build() creates fresh object
3. **No Shared State**: Builder manages its own fields
4. **Validation**: Ensures consistent state

**For maximum thread safety: Use individual builder instances per thread.**
